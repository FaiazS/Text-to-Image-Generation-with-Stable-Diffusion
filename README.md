# Text-to-Image-Generation-with-Stable-Diffusion

This project demonstrates how to generate high-quality images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion model on Google Colab. It leverages Hugging Face’s Diffusers library and PyTorch for running the model. This implementation allows you to quickly experiment with the power of text-to-image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.

#Project Overview:

In this project, we use a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to generate images based on user-defined text prompts like "Northern Lights," "Cats flying above Burj Khalifa," and more. You can easily set up and run this project directly within Google Colab to generate multiple images from your prompts and display them in a clean, organized grid layout.

#Key Features:

Text-to-Image Generation: Transform descriptive text prompts into visually compelling images.

Batch Image Creation: Generate multiple images at once and organize them in a grid.

GPU Acceleration: Leverage Colab’s free GPU to speed up the image generation process.

Easy Setup: Simply run a series of code cells in a Google Colab notebook to generate images.

#Technologies Used:

Python 3.x

Stable Diffusion (Text-to-Image Model)

Hugging Face Diffusers Library: For accessing the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.

PyTorch: For model management and computation.
